How to download and run the program:

1. Extract the compressed zip folder
2. How to open the .jar file
To open the .jar file you must ensure that you are opening it with javaw.exe not java.exe.
To know whether you are doing this right click on the .jar file and then choose another app. Scroll down until you see "Choose an app on your PC".
Your directory to javaw.exe may be slightly different but it most likely will be this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_202\bin\javaw.exe.
Click on javaw.exe and run with that.
